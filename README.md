# Loan Prediciton Neural Network
A simple 3 layered neural network trained on a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhavikjikadara/loan-status-prediction) by [Bhavik Jikadara](https://www.kaggle.com/bhavikjikadara).
- This is a simple solution averaging at around 67.74% accuracy.
- The original dataset was modified since I do not understand how to work with labels (as of the day I'm writing this)
- Rows containing null values were deleted in the data cleanup (again because I wanted to simplify this process for me)
> This is one of my first ML projects and therefore might be extremely basic and innacurate. Be kind :)

## Instructions:
#### Local Runtime using Python3
1. Clone/download the files.
2. Make sure you have Python3 and the following dependencies installed: `tensorflow`, `pandas`, `numpy,`, `matplotlib`, `sklearn` 
4. Run `main.py` using CLI command `python3 main.py`
5. The runtime shouldn't take more than 20s (at most).

#### Jupyter Notebook (or) Google Colab
1. Initialise Jupyter Notebook (or) Google Colab (for Colab, you need to connect to a runtime server)
2. Make sure that your runtime server has Python3 and the following dependencies installed: `tensorflow`, `pandas`, `numpy,`, `matplotlib`, `sklearn` 
3. Upload all the files provided (you may skip the main.py file)
4. Run the `loan_predictor.ipynb` file, cell-by-cell.

Have a great day:)
